Useable examples of the ‘VtpSend’ and ‘VtpTrack’ applications are provided in this folder.  

These samples (provided as ‘.cmd’ files) illustrate a variety of useage options for both applications and require some custom manual changes 
prior to being executed.  It is recommended that upon installation, the user goes to this folder, views an edits these files and then executes each.

These “.cmd” examples are very well documented outlining the functionality and edits required for each. Refer to the VTP user guide to understand the 
content of the file and intended behaviour.  After the file is edited correctly, simply “double-click” on the desired “.cmd” file to observe the behaviour 
of the scenario.  
  
These examples may be modified by the user to fit their desired commercial behaviour or the user may create their own directly.
